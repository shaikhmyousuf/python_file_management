# python_file_management
File management operations for daily use.

Python can be a useful tool to manage files in your computer. 
I recently wanted to rename multiple files in different folders while preparing data for use with a machine learning model.
This made me realise the importance of the os library and its applicaitons. 

My work regarding the above and more will be in this repo.
